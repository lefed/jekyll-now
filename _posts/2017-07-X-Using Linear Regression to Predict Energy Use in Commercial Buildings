title: Predicting Energy Use in Commercial Buildings in SF Using Linear Regression
---

Energy use among commercial buildings is highly variable, and has a significant impact on national GHG emissions and power supply needs for the electricity grid.

For a recent machine learning project, I chose to try to use linear regression techniques to predict the per square foot energy use intensity (EUI) of commercial buildings in San Francisco.

Below is a brief overview of my project and conclusions.

### Combining Two Datasets

I chose to combine two data sets for this project. I used information from the [City of San Francisco's Existing Commercial Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance Report](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/Existing-Commercial-Buildings-Energy-Performance-O/j2j3-acqj)
in order to provide my 'target' for my machine learning algorithm - in this case I used 2015 weather normalized EUI in kBTU/SF - in combination with commercial property data scraped from the [SF Planning Department's Property Information Map](http://propertymap.sfplanning.org/) using Selenium and Beautiful Soup.
